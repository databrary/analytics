## About

These pages summarize information about the Databrary data library.

## Purpose {-}

The separate reports take different views of Databrary's holdings.
The goal of the reports together is to provide useful information to the people who are running the repository and to those who wish to use data from it.

For information about Databrary, see <https://databrary.github.io/guide/>.

## History {-}

This report was offline for a year during the transition to the Databrary 2 system that went live to the research community in March 2025.

We expect to add additional reports now that full scriptable API access is available.
